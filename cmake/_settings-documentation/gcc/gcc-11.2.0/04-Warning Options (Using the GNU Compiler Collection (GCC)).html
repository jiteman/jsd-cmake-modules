<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>
<a name="index-options-to-control-warnings"></a>
<a name="index-warning-messages"></a>
<a name="index-messages_002c-warning"></a>
<a name="index-suppressing-warnings"></a>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</p>
<p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-syntax-checking"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsyntax-only"></a>
<p>Check the code for syntax errors, but don’t do anything beyond that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmax-errors=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmax-errors"></a>
<p>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> is also
specified, then <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> takes precedence over this
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-w</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-w"></a>
<p>Inhibit all warning messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-error"></a>
<p>Make all warnings into errors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-error_003d"></a>
<p>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp>-Werror=switch</samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp>-Wswitch</samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp>-Werror</samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp>-Wno-error=switch</samp> makes
<samp>-Wswitch</samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp>-Werror</samp>
is in effect.
</p>
<p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp>-Werror=</samp> and <samp>-Wno-error=</samp> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</samp> flag.)
</p>
<p>Note that specifying <samp>-Werror=</samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp>-W</samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp>-Wno-error=</samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wfatal-errors"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-fatal-errors"></a>
<p>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
‘<samp>-W</samp>’, for example <samp>-Wimplicit</samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning ‘<samp>-Wno-</samp>’ to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp>-Wno-implicit</samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
Additional warnings can be produced by enabling the static analyzer;
See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#Static-Analyzer-Options">Static Analyzer Options</a>.
</p>
<p>Some options, such as <samp>-Wall</samp> and <samp>-Wextra</samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp>-Wunused</samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp>-Wunused-value</samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.
</p>
<p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp>-Wunknown-warning</samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp>-Wno-</samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp>-Wno-unknown-warning</samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp>-Wno-</samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of some warnings depends on optimizations also being
enabled. For example <samp>-Wsuggest-final-types</samp> is more effective
with link-time optimization and some instances of other warnings may
not be issued at all unless optimization is enabled.  While optimization
in general improves the efficacy of control and data flow sensitive
warnings, in some cases it may also cause false positives.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code></dt>
<dt><code>-pedantic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wpedantic"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-pedantic"></a>
<p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp>-std</samp> option used.
</p>
<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp>-ansi</samp> or a
<samp>-std</samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wpedantic</samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with ‘<samp>__</samp>’.  This alternate
format can also be used to disable warnings for non-ISO ‘<samp>__intN</samp>’ types,
i.e. ‘<samp>__intN__</samp>’.
Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.
</p>
<p>Some users try to use <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all—only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
</p>
<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>.  We don’t have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
</p>
<p>Where the standard specified with <samp>-std</samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as ‘<samp>gnu90</samp>’ or ‘<samp>gnu99</samp>’, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-errors-1"></a>
<p>Give an error whenever the <em>base standard</em> (see <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp>-Werror=pedantic</samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wall</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wall"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-all"></a>
<p>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

<p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp>-Wall</samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp>-Wextra</samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

<p>The option <samp>-Wextra</samp> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A pointer is compared against integer zero with <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>.

</li><li> (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared

<dt><code>-Wabi <span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wabi"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-abi"></a>

<p>Warn about code affected by ABI changes.  This includes code that may
not be compatible with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI as well as the psABI
for the particular target.
</p>
<p>Since G++ now defaults to updating the ABI with each major release,
normally <samp>-Wabi</samp> warns only about C++ ABI compatibility
problems if there is a check added later in a release series for an
ABI issue discovered since the initial release.  <samp>-Wabi</samp> warns
about more things if an older ABI version is selected (with
<samp>-fabi-version=<var>n</var></samp>).
</p>
<p><samp>-Wabi</samp> can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about C++ ABI compatibility with a particular <samp>-fabi-version</samp>
level, e.g. <samp>-Wabi=2</samp> to warn about changes relative to
<samp>-fabi-version=2</samp>.
</p>
<p>If an explicit version number is provided and
<samp>-fabi-compat-version</samp> is not specified, the version number
from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit
version number is provided with this option, but
<samp>-fabi-compat-version</samp> is specified, that version number is
used for C++ ABI warnings.
</p>
<p>Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.
</p>
<p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
</p>
<p>Known incompatibilities in <samp>-fabi-version=2</samp> (which was the
default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly:
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">extern int N;
template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}
</pre></div>

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=3</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> SIMD vector types declared using <code>__attribute ((vector_size))</code> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.

<p>The mangling was changed in <samp>-fabi-version=4</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> <code>__attribute ((const))</code> and <code>noreturn</code> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <code>decltype</code> of a plain declaration was folded away.

<p>These mangling issues were fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=5</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <code>va_arg</code> to complain.
On most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <code>int</code>.

<p>Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code>, prefix increment/decrement, and
a class scope function used as a template argument.
</p>
<p>These issues were corrected in <samp>-fabi-version=6</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
ABI changed the mangling of <code>nullptr_t</code>.

<p>These issues were corrected in <samp>-fabi-version=7</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=8</samp>, the default for GCC 5.1.
</p>
</li><li> <code>decltype(nullptr)</code> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a <code>nullptr_t</code> parameter, as parameters have a
minimum alignment.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=9</samp>, the default for GCC 5.2.
</p>
</li><li> Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a type, such as
ia32 calling conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.),
did not affect the mangled name, leading to name collisions when
function pointers were used as template arguments.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=10</samp>, the default for GCC 6.1.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>This option also enables warnings about psABI-related changes.
The known psABI changes at this point include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For SysV/x86-64, unions with <code>long double</code> members are
passed in memory as specified in psABI.  Prior to GCC 4.4, this was not
the case.  For example:

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">union U {
  long double ld;
  int i;
};
</pre></div>

<p><code>union U</code> is now always passed in memory.
</p>
</li></ul>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wchar-subscripts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wchar-subscripts"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-char-subscripts"></a>
<p>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wno-coverage-mismatch"></a>
<a name="index-Wcoverage-mismatch"></a>
<p>Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp> option.
If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp>
and with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <samp>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to disable the
warning or <samp>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-coverage-invalid-line-number</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wno-coverage-invalid-line-number"></a>
<a name="index-Wcoverage-invalid-line-number"></a>
<p>Warn in case a function ends earlier than it begins due
to an invalid linenum macros.  The warning is emitted only
with <samp>--coverage</samp> enabled.
</p>

<p>Give a warning when a value of type <code>float</code> is implicitly
promoted to <code>double</code>.  CPUs with a 32-bit “single-precision”
floating-point unit implement <code>float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code>double</code> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <code>double</code> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.
</p>
<p>It is easy to accidentally do computations with <code>double</code> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <code>double</code>.  For
example, in:
</p><div class="smallexample">

<p>Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as <code>sprintf</code>
and <code>vsprintf</code> that might overflow the destination buffer.  When the
exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot be determined
at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the

<a name="index-Wno-format-overflow-1"></a>
<p>Level <var>1</var> of <samp>-Wformat-overflow</samp> enabled by <samp>-Wformat</samp>
employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive’s precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <code>sprintf</code>
below is diagnosed because even with both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> equal to zero,
the terminating NUL character (<code>'\0'</code>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (int a, int b)
{
  char buf [13];
  sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
}
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=2</code></dt>
<dd><p>Level <var>2</var> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<var>2</var>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive’s precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.
</p>
<p>At level <var>2</var>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <var>a</var> equal to a 32-bit <code>INT_MIN</code> the first
<code>%i</code> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.
</p>
<p>An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <code>short int</code> type then using either the <code>%hi</code> format
directive or casting the argument to <code>short</code> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.

<p>Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable,
GCC provides an attribute, <code>__attribute__ ((fallthrough))</code>, that is
to be used along with a null statement to suppress this warning that

</p>
<div class="smallexample">

<p>C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</samp>
warning using <code>[[fallthrough]];</code> instead of the GNU attribute.  In C++11
or C++14 users can use <code>[[gnu::fallthrough]];</code>, which is a GNU extension.
Instead of these attributes, it is also possible to add a fallthrough comment
to silence the warning.  The whole body of the C or C++ style comment should

</p>
<ul>
<li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</samp> disables the warning altogether.

<code>cold</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>hot</code>, <code>leaf</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
<code>nonnull</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, <code>pure</code>,
<code>returns_nonnull</code>, and <code>returns_twice</code>.
</p>
<p>In C++, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization of a primary
template declared with attribute <code>alloc_align</code>, <code>alloc_size</code>,
<code>assume_aligned</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>format_arg</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
or <code>nonnull</code> is declared without it.  Attributes <code>deprecated</code>,
<code>error</code>, and <code>warning</code> suppress the warning.
(see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p>You can use the <code>copy</code> attribute to apply the same
set of attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration without
explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute can be applied
to declarations of functions (see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>),
variables (see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Variable-Attributes.html#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>), or types
(see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Type-Attributes.html#Common-Type-Attributes">Common Type Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p><samp>-Wmissing-attributes</samp> is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
<p>For example, since the declaration of the primary function template
below makes use of both attribute <code>malloc</code> and <code>alloc_size</code>
the declaration of the explicit specialization of the template is
diagnosed because it is missing one of the attributes.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

<a name="index-Wno-missing-profile"></a>
<p>This option controls warnings if feedback profiles are missing when using the
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp> option.
This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added
between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> and with
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp>, without regenerating the profiles.
In these cases, the profile feedback data files do not contain any
profile feedback information for
the newly added function or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile
count data (.gcda) files are removed, GCC cannot use any profile feedback
information.  In all these cases, warnings are issued to inform you that a
profile generation step is due.
Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.
<samp>-Wno-missing-profile</samp> can be used to
disable the warning, but this is not recommended and should be done only
when non-existent profile data is justified.

<a name="index-Wno-mismatched-dealloc"></a>

<p>Warn for calls to deallocation functions with pointer arguments returned
from from allocations functions for which the former isn’t a suitable
deallocator.  A pair of functions can be associated as matching allocators
and deallocators by use of attribute <code>malloc</code>.  Unless disabled by
the <samp>-fno-builtin</samp> option the standard functions <code>calloc</code>,
<code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and <code>free</code>, as well as the corresponding
forms of C++ <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code> are implicitly
associated as matching allocators and deallocators.  In the following
example <code>mydealloc</code> is the deallocator for pointers returned from
<code>myalloc</code>.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void mydealloc (void*);

__attribute__ ((malloc (mydealloc, 1))) void*

</pre></div>

<p>In C++, the related option <samp>-Wmismatched-new-delete</samp> diagnoses
mismatches involving either <code>operator new</code> or <code>operator delete</code>.

<dt><code>-Wmultistatement-macros</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wmultistatement-macros"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-multistatement-macros"></a>
<p>Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded
by a clause such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>, or
<code>while</code>, in which only the first statement is actually guarded after
the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT x++; y++
if (c)
  DOIT;
</pre></div>

<p>will increment <code>y</code> unconditionally, not just when <code>c</code> holds.
The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while loop:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
if (c)
  DOIT;
</pre></div>

<dt><code>-Wparentheses</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wparentheses"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-parentheses"></a>
<p>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
</p>
<p>Also warn if a comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is
equivalent to <code>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</code>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</p>
<p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<code>?:</code> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <code>?</code>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
</p>
<p>For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  // Declares a local variable called mymutex.
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex);
  // User meant std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex);

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wsequence-point</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wsequence-point"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-sequence-point"></a>
<p>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.
</p>
<p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence points</em>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
</p>
<p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that “Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.”.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
</p>
<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
</p>
<p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this option will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C++.
</p>
<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>.

return value in a function whose return type is not <code>void</code>
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value).
</p>
<p>For C only, warn about a <code>return</code> statement with an expression in a
function whose return type is <code>void</code>, unless the expression type is
also <code>void</code>.  As a GNU extension, the latter case is accepted
without a warning unless <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is used.  Attempting
to use the return value of a non-<code>void</code> function other than <code>main</code>
that flows off the end by reaching the closing curly brace that terminates
the function is undefined.
</p>
<p>Unlike in C, in C++, flowing off the end of a non-<code>void</code> function other
than <code>main</code> results in undefined behavior even when the value of
the function is not used.

constructors.
</p>
<p>In addition, passing a pointer (or in C++, a reference) to an uninitialized
object to a <code>const</code>-qualified argument of a built-in function known to

</p>
<p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized elements of
structure, union or array variables as well as for variables that are
uninitialized as a whole.  They do not occur for variables or elements
declared <code>volatile</code>.  Because these warnings depend on
optimization, the exact variables or elements for which there are
warnings depend on the precise optimization options and version of GCC

for invocations of <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html#g_t_005f_005fatomic-Builtins">__atomic Builtins</a>, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fsync-Builtins.html#g_t_005f_005fsync-Builtins">__sync Builtins</a>,
and the C11 atomic generic functions with a memory consistency argument
that is either invalid for the operation or outside the range of values
of the <code>memory_order</code> enumeration.  For example, since the
<code>__atomic_store</code> and <code>__atomic_store_n</code> built-ins are only
defined for the relaxed, release, and sequentially consistent memory
orders the following code is diagnosed:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void store (int *i)
{
  __atomic_store_n (i, 0, memory_order_consume);
}
</pre></div>

<p><samp>-Winvalid-memory-model</samp> is enabled by default.

<dt><code>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wmaybe-uninitialized"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-maybe-uninitialized"></a>
<p>For an object with automatic or allocated storage duration, if there exists
a path from the function entry to a use of the object that is initialized,
but there exist some other paths for which the object is not initialized,
the compiler emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths
are not executed at run time.
</p>
<p>In addition, passing a pointer (or in C++, a reference) to an uninitialized
object to a <code>const</code>-qualified function argument is also diagnosed by
this warning.  (<samp>-Wuninitialized</samp> is issued for built-in functions
known to read the object.)  Annotating the function with attribute
<code>access (none)</code> indicates that the argument isn’t used to access
the object and avoids the warning (see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p>These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
GCC does not keep track of the state of variables.
</p>
<p>These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn’t know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.
</p>
<a name="index-longjmp-warnings"></a>
<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.
The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
</p>
<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

The use of constructor and destructor attributes allow you to assign a

<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <samp>-O</samp> 
works.
<samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</samp>.
</p>
<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 3 (default for <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

<dd><a name="index-Wstrict-overflow"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-strict-overflow"></a>
<p>This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
</p>
<p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

zero.  <samp>-Wstrict-overflow</samp> (with no level) is the same as

owing to the length of one argument being greater than the size of

<p>Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as <code>memcpy</code> and
<code>strcpy</code> that are determined to overflow the destination buffer.  The
optional argument is one greater than the type of Object Size Checking to
perform to determine the size of the destination.  See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Object-Size-Checking.html#Object-Size-Checking">Object Size Checking</a>.
The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays
but not for raw memory functions like <code>memcpy</code> which always make use
of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size
in excess of the largest possible object or at most <code>SIZE_MAX / 2</code> bytes.
The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the GCC built-in functions like <code>__builtin_memcpy</code> that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins.  For example, the option issues a warning for
the <code>strcpy</code> call below because it copies at least 5 characters
(the string <code>"blue"</code> including the terminating NUL) into the buffer
of size 4.

<p>Do not warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions
such as <code>strncat</code>,
<code>strncpy</code>, and <code>stpncpy</code> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncat</code> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <code>bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)</code> as the bound.

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)

  strncat (buf, ".txt", 3);
}
</pre></div>

<p>As another example, the following call to <code>strncpy</code> results in copying
to <code>d</code> just the characters preceding the terminating NUL, without
appending the NUL to the end.  Assuming the result of <code>strncpy</code> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <code>memcpy</code> instead.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (char *d, const char *s)
{
  strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncpy</code> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <code>sizeof buf - 1</code> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <code>NUL</code>.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (const char *s)

resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <code>format</code>
attribute to avoid the warning.
</p>
<p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC guesses that <code>format</code> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like

<dd><a name="index-Walloca-larger-than_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-alloca-larger-than"></a>
<p>This option warns on calls to <code>alloca</code> with an integer argument whose
value is either zero, or that is not bounded by a controlling predicate
that limits its value to at most <var>byte-size</var>.  It also warns for calls
to <code>alloca</code> where the bound value is unknown.  Arguments of non-integer
types are considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to
the expected range.
</p>
<p>For example, a bounded case of <code>alloca</code> could be:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (size_t n)
{
  void *p;
  if (n &lt;= 1000)
    p = alloca (n);
  else
    p = malloc (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, passing <code>-Walloca-larger-than=1000</code> would not
issue a warning because the call to <code>alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.
</p>
<p>Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <code>alloca</code> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func ()
{
  void *p = alloca (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.
</p>
<p>Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (signed int n)
{
  if (n &lt; 500)
    {
      p = alloca (n);
      f (p);
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, <var>n</var> could be negative, causing a larger than

<p>Warn about redeclarations of functions involving arguments of array or
pointer types of inconsistent kinds or forms, and enable the detection
of out-of-bounds accesses to such parameters by warnings such as
<samp>-Warray-bounds</samp>.
</p>
<p>If the first function declaration uses the array form the bound specified
in the array is assumed to be the minimum number of elements expected to
be provided in calls to the function and the maximum number of elements
accessed by it.  Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or accessing
more than the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed by warnings such
as <samp>-Warray-bounds</samp>.  At level 1 the warning diagnoses inconsistencies
involving array parameters declared using the <code>T[static N]</code> form.
</p>
<p>For example, the warning triggers for the following redeclarations because
the first one allows an array of any size to be passed to <code>f</code> while
the second one with the keyword <code>static</code> specifies that the array
argument must have at least four elements.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (int[static 4]);
void f (int[]);           // warning (inconsistent array form)

{
  int *p = (int *)malloc (4);
  f (p);                  // warning (array too small)
  …
}
</pre></div>

<p>At level 2 the warning also triggers for redeclarations involving any other
inconsistency in array or pointer argument forms denoting array sizes.
Pointers and arrays of unspecified bound are considered equivalent and do
not trigger a warning.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

<p>Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for
most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.

<p>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
</p>
<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that’s a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

<p>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

</li><li> In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the ‘<samp>#</samp>’ appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp>-Wtraditional</samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the ‘<samp>#</samp>’ does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

</li><li> A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

</li><li> The unary plus operator.

</li><li> The ‘<samp>U</samp>’ integer constant suffix, or the ‘<samp>F</samp>’ or ‘<samp>L</samp>’ floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the ‘<samp>L</samp>’ suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the ‘<samp>_MIN</samp>’/‘<samp>_MAX</samp>’ macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC’s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

</li><li> A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

</li><li> A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

</li><li> A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

</li><li> The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

</li><li> Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

</li><li> Initialization of automatic aggregates.

</li><li> Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

</li><li> Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

</li><li> Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp>-Wtraditional-conversion</samp>.

</li><li> Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty’s traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

(in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.  Note
that in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an
explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.
If this warning is enabled, it includes also all instances of
local shadowing.  This means that <samp>-Wno-shadow=local</samp>

<dd><a name="index-Wshadow_003dcompatible-local"></a>
<p>Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable.  In C++,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable.  The creation of this flag
(in addition to <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
  {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>Since the two variable <code>i</code> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <samp>-Wshadow=compatible-local</samp> does not emit a warning.
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking is expected to catch that and emit an
error or warning.  Use of this flag instead of <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.
Note that this also means that shadowing <code>const char *i</code> by
<code>char *i</code> does not emit a warning.
</p>

the innermost <code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code>
can belong to the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code

<p>Warn for suspicious calls to the <code>memset</code> built-in function where
the second argument is not zero and the third argument is zero.  For
example, the call <code>memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)</code> is diagnosed because
<code>memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)</code> was meant instead.  The diagnostic
is only emitted if the third argument is a literal zero.  Otherwise, if
it is an expression that is folded to zero, or a cast of zero to some

<pre class="smallexample">void f (const char *x)

  if (x == "abc")   // warning: expression evaluates to false
    puts ("equal");

</pre></div>
<p>and tests of the results of pointer addition or subtraction for equality
to null, such as in
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (const int *p, int i)
{
  return p + i == NULL;
}
</pre></div>
<p>Such uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of most
functions and objects necessarily evaluates to true (the exception are
weak symbols), so their use in a conditional might indicate missing
parentheses in a function call or a missing dereference in an array
expression.  The subset of the warning for object pointers can be
suppressed by casting the pointer operand to an integer type such
as <code>inptr_t</code> or <code>uinptr_t</code>.
Comparisons against string literals result in unspecified behavior
and are not portable, and suggest the intent was to call <code>strcmp</code>.
The warning is suppressed if the suspicious expression is the result
of macro expansion.
<samp>-Waddress</samp> warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.

bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.  Also warns when
the operands of a logical operator are the same:
</p><div class="smallexample">

</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int a;
…
if (!a &gt; 1) { … }
</pre></div>

<p>It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS into

<p>Do not warn if an unexpected <code>__attribute__</code> is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
</p>
<p>Additionally, using <samp>-Wno-attributes=</samp>, it is possible to suppress
warnings about unknown scoped attributes (in C++11 and C2X).  For example,
<samp>-Wno-attributes=vendor::attr</samp> disables warning about the following
declaration:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">[[vendor::attr]] void f();
</pre></div>

<p>It is also possible to disable warning about all attributes in a namespace
using <samp>-Wno-attributes=vendor::</samp> which prevents warning about both
of these declarations:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">[[vendor::safe]] void f();
[[vendor::unsafe]] void f2();

<p>Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature

declared without a prototype.  The <samp>-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch</samp>
warning is enabled by default.  To avoid the warning include the appropriate
header to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.
</p>
<p>For example, the call to <code>memset</code> below is diagnosed by the warning
because the function expects a value of type <code>size_t</code> as its argument
but the type of <code>32</code> is <code>int</code>.  With <samp>-Wextra</samp>,
the declaration of the function is diagnosed as well.

<p>In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <em>normalization rules</em> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
</p>
<p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfc</samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 “C” normalized form, <em>NFC</em>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp>-Wnormalized</samp>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there’s no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<samp>-Wnormalized=id</samp> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
</p>
<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp>-Wnormalized=none</samp> or <samp>-Wno-normalized</samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
“D”), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.
</p>
<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, “SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N”, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfkc</samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

<dt><code>-Wpacked</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wpacked"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-packed"></a>
<p>Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <code>f.x</code> in <code>struct bar</code>
is misaligned even though <code>struct bar</code> does not itself
have the packed attribute:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct foo {
  int x;
  char a, b, c, d;
} __attribute__((packed));
struct bar {
  char z;

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wnopacked-bitfield-compat</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wpacked-bitfield-compat"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat"></a>
<p>The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the <code>packed</code> attribute
on bit-fields of type <code>char</code>.  This was fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code> in this structure:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct foo
{
  char a:4;
  char b:8;
} __attribute__ ((packed));
</pre></div>

<p>This warning is enabled by default.  Use

<p>Warn if a structure field with explicitly specified alignment in a
packed struct or union is misaligned.  For example, a warning will
be issued on <code>struct S</code>, like, <code>warning: alignment 1 of
'struct S' is less than 8</code>, in this code:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S8 { char a[8]; };
struct __attribute__ ((packed)) S {

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wpadded</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wpadded"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-padded"></a>
<p>Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
</p>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wrestrict</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wrestrict"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-restrict"></a>
<p>Warn when an object referenced by a <code>restrict</code>-qualified parameter
(or, in C++, a <code>__restrict</code>-qualified parameter) is aliased by another
argument, or when copies between such objects overlap.  For example,
the call to the <code>strcpy</code> function below attempts to truncate the string
by replacing its initial characters with the last four.  However, because
the call writes the terminating NUL into <code>a[4]</code>, the copies overlap and
the call is diagnosed.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void foo (void)
{
  char a[] = "abcd1234";
  strcpy (a, a + 4);
  …
}
</pre></div>
<p>The <samp>-Wrestrict</samp> option detects some instances of simple overlap
even without optimization but works best at <samp>-O2</samp> and above.  It
is included in <samp>-Wall</samp>.

<dt><code>-Winline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Winline"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-inline"></a>
<p>Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
</p>
<p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <samp>-Winline</samp> to appear or disappear.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Winterference-size</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Winterference-size"></a>
<p>Warn about use of C++17 <code>std::hardware_destructive_interference_size</code>
without specifying its value with <samp>--param destructive-interference-size</samp>.
Also warn about questionable values for that option.
</p>
<p>This variable is intended to be used for controlling class layout, to
avoid false sharing in concurrent code:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct independent_fields {
  alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) std::atomic&lt;int&gt; one;
  alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) std::atomic&lt;int&gt; two;
};
</pre></div>

<p>Here ‘<samp>one</samp>’ and ‘<samp>two</samp>’ are intended to be far enough apart
that stores to one won’t require accesses to the other to reload the
cache line.
</p>
<p>By default, <samp>--param destructive-interference-size</samp> and
<samp>--param constructive-interference-size</samp> are set based on the
current <samp>-mtune</samp> option, typically to the L1 cache line size
for the particular target CPU, sometimes to a range if tuning for a
generic target.  So all translation units that depend on ABI
compatibility for the use of these variables must be compiled with
the same <samp>-mtune</samp> (or <samp>-mcpu</samp>).
</p>
<p>If ABI stability is important, such as if the use is in a header for a
library, you should probably not use the hardware interference size
variables at all.  Alternatively, you can force a particular value
with <samp>--param</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you are confident that your use of the variable does not affect ABI
outside a single build of your project, you can turn off the warning
with <samp>-Wno-interference-size</samp>.

<dt><code>-Wvector-operation-performance</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wvector-operation-performance"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-vector-operation-performance"></a>
<p>Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented <code>piecewise</code>, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
<code>in parallel</code>, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and <code>as a single scalar</code>, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wvla</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wvla"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-vla"></a>

<dd><a name="index-Wvla-larger-than_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-vla-larger-than"></a>
<p>If this option is used, the compiler warns for declarations of
variable-length arrays whose size is either unbounded, or bounded
by an argument that allows the array size to exceed <var>byte-size</var>
bytes.  This is similar to how <samp>-Walloca-larger-than=</samp><var>byte-size</var>
works, but with variable-length arrays.
</p>
<p>Note that GCC may optimize small variable-length arrays of a known
value into plain arrays, so this warning may not get triggered for
such arrays.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wvla-larger-than=</samp>‘<samp>PTRDIFF_MAX</samp>’ is enabled by default but
is typically only effective when <samp>-ftree-vrp</samp> is active (default
for <samp>-O2</samp> and above).

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wvla-parameter</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wno-vla-parameter"></a>
<p>Warn about redeclarations of functions involving arguments of Variable
Length Array types of inconsistent kinds or forms, and enable the detection
of out-of-bounds accesses to such parameters by warnings such as
<samp>-Warray-bounds</samp>.
</p>
<p>If the first function declaration uses the VLA form the bound specified
in the array is assumed to be the minimum number of elements expected to
be provided in calls to the function and the maximum number of elements
accessed by it.  Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or
accessing more than the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed.
</p>
<p>For example, the warning triggers for the following redeclarations because
the first one allows an array of any size to be passed to <code>f</code> while
the second one specifies that the array argument must have at least <code>n</code>
elements.  In addition, calling <code>f</code> with the associated VLA bound
parameter in excess of the actual VLA bound triggers a warning as well.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (int n, int[n]);
void f (int, int[]);     // warning: argument 2 previously declared as a VLA

      return;
    int a[n];
    f (sizeof a, a);     // warning: access to a by f may be out of bounds
  …

<dt><code>-Wdisabled-optimization</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wdisabled-optimization"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-disabled-optimization"></a>
<p>Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC’s optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.

</dd>
<dt><code>-Woverlength-strings</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Woverlength-strings"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-overlength-strings"></a>
<p>Warn about string constants that are longer than the “minimum
maximum” length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard’s minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
</p>
<p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
</p>
<p>This option is implied by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, and can be disabled with
<samp>-Wno-overlength-strings</samp>.
